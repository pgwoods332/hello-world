Hi Everybody, 

My name is Peter Woods. I am currently in the process of learning to become a web-developer and have been learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript since about November (2017).  I am originally from Columbus, Montana until moving to Missoula, Montana in 2004.  I am currently in the proces of relocating to Glendale, AZ.
